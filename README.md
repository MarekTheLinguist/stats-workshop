## Workshop in statistics

This is a repository with files and instructions to the statistics workshop.

R is a programming language used for statistical computing. R is used universally in linguistics, psychology and the social sciences to run statistical tests and perform modelling. It's open source, available free of charge (unlike some other software, like IBM SPSS), and highly extensible through many of its libraries (we will use some of them). R is a functional language, which means that we apply mathematical functions to objects we manipulate. It also has multiple functionalities for "data wrangling", meaning that it is possible to prepare and modify data within it. An added benefit of using R is that you can share your code, rendering your research reproducible. Through its libraries, R is able to produce very nice plots that you can easily adjust to your needs: check it for yourselves! https://r-graph-gallery.com/

You can of course write R code in a notepad and then run it from terminal/command line, but nobody really does that. R comes with RStudio - an integrated development environment, i.e. a set of tools to develop, modify and test your code.
Before our meeting, please do the following:

    Download and install R: https://cran.radicaldevelop.com/
    Download and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ --> scroll down and find a version that is compatible with your system
    Run RStudio on your computer and check if it works (e.g next to the > type "2+2" and check if it returns a result)
    Install ggplot2, tidyverse, lme4 and afex. How to install libraries? Check here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/install-package-r/

Above the text, you will find resources for our workshop. You can download them by clicking "Code" and selecting "download as zip" from the pull down menu.
